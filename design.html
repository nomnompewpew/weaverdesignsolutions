                                    For businesses, retail stores or restaurants with a limited online presence, I would recommend a custom website that showcases your products, with seasonal or monthly updates. A nice looking website helps complete your "Google My Business" profile. After making a nice looking profile, I can do some basic SEO work and ad campaigns with Google. With a well polished digital image you are much more likely to draw in customers with smartphones who are googling terms like "food near me", "tattoos near me", "accountant near me" etc... &nbsp;<br><br>If you are interested in setting up delivery for your restaurant, I am more than happy to set up your account and manage your menu for any of the popular delivery services available in your area.<br><br>If you have products that are easily shippable, I can help you setup a shipping and payment platform to bring your products to a national audience. If you want to unify your business with a point of sale system that connects to your online platform, I can do that too! Learn more by clicking on the eCommerce tab above.</p>

                                <p class="mbr-text pt-4 mbr-fonts-style display-7">My focus is delivering a high quality service without hidden monthly costs or expensive updates. I am happy to build your drag and drop site and manage it for you, but I prefer to build a custom website with plugins that we hand pick and add to your site to lower costs. Drag and drop site builders tend to have 3rd party apps or plugins that cost monthly for each little feature you want to add even after the monthly fees the builder charges. The solutions I come up with generally require more setup or even a bit of coding, but they come at a much lower cost (sometimes free) than drag and drop site builders.<br><br>My first project had a high difficulty level due to the high-risk category the business is placed in by credit and debit card insurers. Hemp/CBD is listed alongside products such as nutraceutical, adult subscription services or toys, tobacco and kratom. If you sell handmade products, apparel, artwork, sporting goods, band merch or other low risk items it will be very simple to setup a store with a payment processor and shipping platform that automates most of your work. I am still willing to work with other high-risk products and services, but it may take more time to gain approval and my services for high-risk sites will be higher.</p>

The more clicks you get for a given search term that results in a conversion, the more likely Google will up your ranking. Connecting and using the available Google tools like Google My Business, Search Console, Analytics and Ads is the best way to get ranked quickly and start getting conversions that translate to sales or foot traffic to your business.

<br>With the Google suite of tools I can set a monthly budget for ads, setup reporting and track progress as Google optimizes your search terms to connect potential customers with your business.</p>

It is up to you to provide excellent customer service and a great product to get those awesome reviews.

I will make the highest quality logos I can but might be unable to animate or render complex logos. I was able to make the logo you see at the top left of my site in less than an hour and I can resize it to match any style I need. What I can provide will be a simple and effective logo that can overlay on a site with a transparent background. I can easily work with any logos you currently have and resize or recreate them as needed.<br><br>I have a few professional photographers that I can work with to take photos of your products, your storefront or anything else you might like to add to your website for a personal touch.</p>
